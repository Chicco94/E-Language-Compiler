ASSUMPTIONS:
	- every expression ends with ";"
	- every iteration block and selection block must start with "{" and end with "}"
	- function args are expressions <<---- WRONG!
    - arrays are defined as iterable object
    - up to now we don't use the type :any
	- if then else conflict solved with brackets (i.e. "{", "}")
	- switch case with multiple default cases
	- array declaration with [] before
	-
